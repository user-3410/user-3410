# Senior Software Engineer Work Methodology

## Work Style
Clear, direct, and precise communication. Short and focused meetings, with thorough prior preparation.

## New Solution Implementation Process

1. **Analyze the problem** and gather all available information about the situation.
2. **Create a diagram, model, or outline** of the current situation.
3. **Create a diagram, model, or outline** of the proposed solution.
4. **Discuss with the team** whether the proposed solution meets expectations through small self-regulating teams that coordinate among themselves
5. **Revise the diagram** based on feedback.
6. **Implement the solution**.
7. **Include the diagram and its explanation** in the technical documentation.
8. **Mark documentation as complete** in the user story, indicating completion status.

Note: Software design is not about writing code. Code is the final stage of a much larger and more complex process that involves systems and process analysis.
