# Senior Software Engineer Work Methodology

## Work Style
Clear, direct, and precise communication. Short, focused meetings, always supported by thorough preparation.

According to the 16Personalities test, I match the **Mediator (INFP)** profile, which aligns with my tendency toward empathy, adaptability, and value-driven problem solving. This balance allows me to combine logical and literal thinking with a strong sense of collaboration and creativity.

While this is my preferred way of working, I adapt to the teamâ€™s dynamics as long as system stability is not compromised and best practices are followed.

## New Solution Implementation Process

1. **Analyze the problem** and gather all relevant information.  
2. **Model the current state** using a diagram, outline, or equivalent representation.  
3. **Model the proposed solution** in the same way.  
4. **Review with the team** to ensure the proposed solution meets expectations, leveraging small self-regulating teams that coordinate among themselves.  
5. **Revise the model** based on feedback.  
6. **Implement the solution**.  
7. **Update technical documentation** with the final diagram and explanation.  
8. **Mark the documentation as complete** in the user story to indicate full completion.

**Note:** Software design goes far beyond coding. Code is only the final stage of a broader process that involves systems thinking, analysis, and design.
