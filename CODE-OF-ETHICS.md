# Code of Ethics for Software Developers

## Fundamental Principles

### 1. **First, do no harm**
I commit to evaluating the potential negative consequences of my work and to refusing the development of systems that may cause physical, psychological, or social harm to individuals or communities.

### 2. **Transparency and honesty**
I will be transparent about the capabilities, limitations, and risks of the software I develop. I will not hide known defects or exaggerate system functionalities.

### 3. **Privacy and data protection**
I will protect user privacy, implementing appropriate security measures and limiting data collection to the minimum necessary for system functionality.

### 4. **Equity and inclusion**
I will strive to create accessible and inclusive software, avoiding discriminatory biases based on race, gender, age, disability, sexual orientation, or any other personal characteristic.

### 5. **Professional quality**
I will maintain high quality standards in my code, following development best practices, documentation, and testing to ensure reliable and maintainable software.

### 6. **Continuous responsibility**
I assume responsibility for the maintenance and consequences of the software I develop, even after its implementation.

### 7. **Sustainable development**
I will consider the environmental impact of my technical decisions and promote resource-efficient development practices.

### 8. **Professional integrity**
I will keep my technical competence updated and recognize the limits of my knowledge, consulting with experts when necessary.

### 9. **Respect for intellectual property**
I will respect software licenses, copyrights, and intellectual property, giving appropriate credit and complying with legal obligations.

### 10. **Commitment to public interest**
When there is conflict between commercial interests and public welfare, I will prioritize the benefit of society and end users.

### 11. **Ethical industry boundaries**
I will not use my software development skills in industries that are inherently harmful to society, including but not limited to: gambling and sports betting, tobacco, weapons manufacturing, mass surveillance systems, predatory lending, or any industry that systematically exploits vulnerable populations.

## Professional Boundaries and Limits

### Quality vs. Speed Conflicts
- **I will not ship software with known critical security vulnerabilities**, regardless of business pressure or deadlines
- **I will advocate for adequate testing time** and refuse to bypass essential security reviews
- **I will document and escalate quality concerns** when pressured to compromise safety for speed

### Security vs. Functionality Trade-offs
- **Security is non-negotiable** for systems handling sensitive data or critical infrastructure
- **I will implement security by design**, not as an afterthought
- **I will refuse to create backdoors or deliberately weaken security** measures, even when requested by management or clients

### Harm Prevention Boundaries
- **I will not develop software designed to deceive, manipulate, or exploit users**
- **I will refuse to implement dark patterns** that trick users into unwanted actions
- **I will not create systems that facilitate harassment, discrimination, or abuse**

### Professional Limits
- **I will not work on projects beyond my competence** without proper supervision and learning support
- **I will not make false claims** about my skills or the software's capabilities
- **I will escalate ethical concerns** through appropriate channels and, if necessary, refuse to participate in unethical projects
