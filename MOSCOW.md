### 3. MoSCoW + Risk Assessment
Adding risk levels to inform planning:

| Feature | Priority | Risk Level | Risk Factors | Mitigation |
|---------|----------|------------|--------------|------------|
| Payment integration | Must | **High** | 3rd party dependency, compliance | Start early, have backup provider |
| User authentication | Must | **Medium** | Security complexity | Security review, penetration testing |
| Product search | Should | **Low** | Well-known technology | Standard implementation |
| Email notifications | Should | **Medium** | Deliverability issues | Multiple providers, monitoring |
| Real-time chat | Could | **High** | Infrastructure complexity | Prototype first, consider 3rd party |
| Mobile app | Won't | **Very High** | New platform, resource intensive | Next quarter planning |

**Risk Management Rules:**
- **High Risk + Must Have** = Start immediately, need Plan B
